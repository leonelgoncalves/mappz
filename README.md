This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Libraries 

I used PrimeReact and Primeflex for the UI components. Apollo client for the GraphQL queries and mutations. And Tanstack/react-query for the REST API queries (a bit more about it on notes).
